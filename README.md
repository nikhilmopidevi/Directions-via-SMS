# Directions via SMS
### Get directions to a place with just an SMS.

##### This is a desktop application written in Java.

It makes use of [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and [Ozeki NG SMS Gateway](http://www.ozekisms.com/) to fetch directions to a place.

If you have any suggestions for the application, feel free to send a pull request.

### I wrote this application in my early years of programming when still in college. The code in this repository isn't anywhere near to what I write nowadays. I write much better, modular, clean, and efficient code now.
